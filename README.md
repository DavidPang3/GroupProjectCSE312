### for objective 1, 
I included media uploads to my websockets chatbox but the page must be reloaded in order for them to show.
I believe this still completes the minimum requirements for objective 1 as long as I'm able to upload images, 
and I completed the criteria and test cases.

### for objective 2,
the chatbox will be in community, you must be logged in first.

### for objective 3,
my domain will be at "davidpangspersonalwebsite.com". I temporarily made my websocket 'ws' instead of 'wss' so 
the TAs can test it in docker otherwise it wouldn't work but for deployment I will change to 'wss'. My actual
website is secured https and will be using 'wss' for websockets still.
