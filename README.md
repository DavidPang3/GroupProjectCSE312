# Project Part 3
# for objective 1, 
I added a time input below the input message where users can input a time (in seconds) before their message is sent.
Calculated the time on the server side and displayed it using javascript

# for objective 2,
My site will be at https://david.davidpangswebsite.live/ I changed it due to difficulties I had with my previous domain cloudflare when configuring ddos protection.
You must click VERY fast in order to activate the ddos, (50 times in 10 seconds) so you may have to use an autoclicker. Then you will be blocked for 30 seconds from making 
any more requests.

# for objective 3,
Please test this using docker as I'm having some technical issues updating this onto my domain name at the moment (due to git constantly 
crashing and making unremovable indexlocks maybe because of my OneDrive?).
The feature I added was a stats page for logged in users, displaying messages sent, images sent, requests made, or times logged in. 

### extra,
I know my website doesn't look too good especially with having to reload for my images in a chatbox
that automatically updates for texts, but please cut me some slack because I'm working on this project alone. Thankyou.
I will very likely update/polish everything before presentation
