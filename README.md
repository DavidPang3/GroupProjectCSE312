# for objective 1, 
I included media uploads to my websockets chatbox but the page must be reloaded in order for them to show.
I believe this still completes the minimum requirements for objective 1 as long as I'm able to upload images, 
and I completed the criteria and test cases.

## Important
there are password requirements for registration otherwise it will return none, the requirements are the same as the homework's:
minimum 8 in length, includes at least 1 number, 1 letter, 1 capital, and 1 special character

# for objective 2,
the chatbox will be in community, you must be logged in first.

# for objective 3,
my domain will be at "davidpangspersonalwebsite.com". I temporarily made my websocket 'ws' instead of 'wss' so 
the TAs can test it in docker otherwise it wouldn't work but for deployment I will change to 'wss'. My actual
website is secured https and will be using 'wss' for websockets still.

### extra,
I know my website doesn't look too good especially with having to reload for my images in a chatbox
that automatically updates for texts, but please cut me some slack because I'm working on this project alone. Thankyou.
